  - title: "Skill-based matchmaking architecture (SBMM) — open source"
    date: 2024-07-06
    summary: >
      Designing SBMM involves defining objectives, gathering data, and using ELO-based algorithms for skill ratings. AWS provides a scalable and secure infrastructure but presents challenges in cost and complexity. Open-source options like Apache Tomcat and Nginx offer cost-effective scalability solutions.

  - title: "Docker commands are long and boring, here's a better approach"
    date: 2024-02-19
    summary: >
      Docker commands, while powerful, can be long and complex, making them difficult to handle across varied environments. To simplify this, the "dockermake" npm package was created, which uses Makefiles to turn cumbersome commands into simple ones.
