    <p>
      I am deeply passionate about distributed systems, infrastructure and container orchestration.
    </p>
    <p>
      What truly amazes me is how things break in often unpredictable ways as systems scale. It's like watching a high-stakes game of Jenga played out in code and infrastructure. Each optimization, each new layer of complexity, adds both power and fragility. I'm obsessed with finding that sweet spot where performance, reliability, and maintainability converge, always pushing the envelope of what's possible in large-scale distributed computing.
