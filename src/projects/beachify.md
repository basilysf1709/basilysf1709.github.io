In the realm of software development, planning and enjoying summer trips can be daunting, which inspired the creation of "Beachify," an all-in-one summer hack. This project leverages blockchain technology and web3 authentication to streamline beach and park planning, making it easier for users to enjoy their outings.

Beachify simplifies the process by fetching beach information using Yelp's Fusion API, integrating Google Maps for location checks, and rewarding users for their plans via the Hedera Test Network. Built with the MERN stack, Beachify offers a seamless user experience with a clean UI and decentralized authentication. Despite the challenges faced, including integrating Hedera and Google APIs, the project has received accolades for its innovative approach. Beachify is open for future enhancements to further integrate blockchain transactions and refine its user interface.
