**Fiable** is an innovative app designed to reduce air pollution by incentivizing people to bike for shorter distances, offering monetary rewards for choosing this eco-friendly mode of transportation. Inspired by a Y Combinator request for solutions in transportation, the idea for Fiable emerged from brainstorming sessions and user feedback, aiming to make personal transportation more sustainable and enjoyable.

**Development** involved initial brainstorming and low-fidelity wireframe creation on Figma, followed by coding the app using React Native. The team faced challenges such as ensuring smooth navigation and real-time location tracking, but they successfully integrated Google Cloud Platform APIs and developed a user-friendly interface.

**Achievements** include a minimalistic design that enhances the user experience, seamless integration of location services, and creating an app that promotes environmental consciousness. Future plans for Fiable involve improving state management with Redux, enhancing polyline functionalities, and making design and security improvements. The project, developed by Basil Yusuf, Naol Denko, and Rashi Mathur, won the People's Choice and Best Use of Google Cloud awards at GryphHacks 2022.
